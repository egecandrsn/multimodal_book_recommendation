**Multi-Modal Book Recommendation System**

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/egecandrsn/multimodal_book_recommendation/blob/main/book_recommendation_preprocess.ipynb)
This GitHub repository contains the code for a multi-modal book recommendation system implemented in a Google Colab notebook. The system leverages a Kaggle dataset, incorporating diverse modalities such as book metadata (author, publication year), book cover images, book descriptions obtained from the Google Books API, and user ratings. The code includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and creating similarity matrices for different modalities. A weighted combination of these matrices is used for recommendation. Additionally, pre-trained models for image and text embeddings are employed to enhance the recommendation process. The system provides a versatile approach to book recommendations by considering multiple aspects of book information. The code also includes features for data filtering, user-item matrix creation, and optimization. It serves as a robust foundation for developing and experimenting with multi-modal book recommendation systems.
